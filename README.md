This is the oasis-direct proxy contract
https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/master/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol

Please create a multi-sig wallet which interacts with oasis-direct through a proxy contract, in the context of the multi-sig wallet.

Please clone this repo and work on any tool you like best. When you are done, please commit to a new branch you create and query us for review.

Requirements: at least two of the oasis-direct functions be implemented.

Note: please put an enphasis on writing well written and commented code.
If you like it better, you can interact with oasis-dex, instead of oasis-direct, at your choice.

Please document in a separate .MD file the tools you use for writing, debugging, testing and teploying the smart contracts, and where you keep track of them in order to manage them. You can deploy on any network you like, please add in the file the network, contract address, bytecode and ABI.
